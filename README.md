# Environment setup for Jupyter notebook
Firstly install Miniconda from [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/).

Then open a command prompt in this directory, and run the following. This will create and activate an environment called "FDS".

```bash
conda create -n fds python=3.12
conda activate fds
```

After running this, your CMD prompt should have a "`(fds)`" prefixed at the start.

Run the following command to install packages, such as [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). This will take some time.

```bash
conda install -n fds ipykernel ipywidgets --update-deps --force-reinstall

pip install scikit-learn opencv-contrib-python-headless matplotlib numpy pandas pillow pyperclip

pip install torch torchvision --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu124
```

You're ready! Now just open VS Code and open the [Jupyter notebook](Notebook.ipynb), and remember to select the FDS environment at the bottom-right.
